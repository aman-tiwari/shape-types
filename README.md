# shape-types

how much math can u do in a type system?

(Re)generate the lookup tables & add/subtract "type functions" with `yarn run build`

`gen_types.ts` generates the types.

Look at `index.ts` for how to use.

TODO:

* Multiplication & Division
* Comparison operators
* Better way to turn literal to array of digits
* Supporting variable digit numbers
* Support turning array of digits back into literal
